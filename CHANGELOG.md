# Changelog

All notable changes to Vibrdrome Web are documented here.

## [ Unreleased ]
- Document Picture-in-Picture support (Chrome native PiP window)

### Changed
- Simplified installed iOS PWA audio transport to a single active media element; removed the failed hidden background resume swap workaround for homescreen mode

### Documented
- Added a README note for the iOS homescreen background-resume limitation with links to the relevant WebKit bug reports

## [1.8.1-beta.2] - 2026-05-05

### Fixed
- Chromecast progress bar froze at 0:00 — position now reads from the cast MediaSession's `getEstimatedTime()` (with `CURRENT_TIME_CHANGED` fallback) instead of the silent local audio element
- Chromecast disconnect (user end-session, network drop, AutoJoin timeout) now resumes playback locally at the same position instead of going silent — Spotify-Connect-style handoff
- Docker healthcheck failed on IPv6-only `localhost` resolution

### Security
- Dockerfile now runs `apk upgrade --no-cache` on the nginx:alpine base, picking up CVE-2026-27135 (HIGH, nghttp2-libs DoS) and any future Alpine security patches at build time

### Changed
- Replaced dynamic `import('./CastManager')` chains in `pause`/`seek`/`setVolume`/`play` with a top-level static import — rapid slider drags no longer spawn out-of-order Promises
- `seek()` no longer touches the local audio element while casting (was logically incorrect; silent in practice)
- Upgraded dev deps: ESLint 10, TypeScript 6, react-hooks 7.1.1; resolved all lint errors

### Tests
- Added 11 unit tests covering `CastManager.getCurrentTime` (with fallbacks), `onSessionEnd` callback delivery, and `PlaybackManager` cast-mode routing for `getPosition`/`seek`/`pause`/`setVolume`

## [1.8.1-beta.1] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Server-side queue sync via OpenSubsonic `indexBasedQueue` extension (Navidrome 0.61+)
- Opt-in "Sync Queue" toggle in Settings > Integrations
- Debounced queue saves (1.5s) to avoid hammering on rapid changes
- Periodic playback position sync every 30s and on pause
- Queue restoration from server on startup when local queue is empty
- Feature detection: falls back to legacy `savePlayQueue`/`getPlayQueue` for non-OpenSubsonic servers
- Local position persistence — playback position saved to localStorage on pause and page unload, restored on reload

### Fixed
- Gapless playback: tracks now advance in correct order when clicking next (spurious ended events no longer trigger wrong preloaded track)
- Now Playing reports accurate time after page reload (position restores from localStorage or server)

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Note
