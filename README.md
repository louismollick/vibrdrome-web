### iOS PWA Note

When installed to the iPhone home screen, iOS can keep background playback running, but resuming after an external pause
(for example from lock-screen controls or Bluetooth headphones) is still unreliable in standalone PWA mode. Vibrdrome
uses a simplified single-audio-element transport path in installed iOS PWAs to avoid making that platform bug worse, but
it cannot fully work around WebKit here.

Relevant WebKit reports:
- [243258: Cannot resume MediaSession from PWA after pause](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243258)
- [243256: MediaSession controls disappear on resume after long pause](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=243256)
- [261858: Standalone web app media session/autoplay regressions](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=261858)

## (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- A running [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) or Subsonic-compatible server

### Install and Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ddmoney420/vibrdrome-web.git
cd vibrdrome-web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and enter your server URL and credentials.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output lands in `dist/` — deploy to any static host (Cloudflare Pages, Vercel, Netlify, etc.).

### Run Tests

```bash
npm run test:run    # Run once
npm run test        # Watch mode
```

120 tests across 11 suites covering stores, API clients, utilities, and hooks.

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ddmoney420/vibrdrome-web
docker run -p 8080:80 ddmoney420/vibrdrome-web
```

Or build from source:

```bash
docker build -t vibrdrome-web .
docker run -p 8080:80 vibrdrome-web
```

Pre-fill the login screen with your server URL (for self-hosted deployments):

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -e VIBRDROME_DEFAULT_SERVER=https://music.example.com ddmoney420/vibrdrome-web
```

Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  vibrdrome-web:
    image: ddmoney420/vibrdrome-web
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    environment:
      - VIBRDROME_DEFAULT_SERVER=https://music.example.com
    restart: unless-stopped
```
